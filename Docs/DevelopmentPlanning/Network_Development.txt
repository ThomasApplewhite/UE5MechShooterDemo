How do we get two players to interact with each other?
The two players need to:
* Connect to the same server
* Shoot Weapons
* See each other
* Damage each other

[*] Client-side models for other players
	[x] Set correct gun equip animations for players
		* Not important, mechs won't pick up guns mid-fight
[ ] Game connection interface (a basic one, so players can connect to each other in builds
	[ ] Local host connection options
	[ ] "Spectator Camera" to give joing players something to look at"
[ ] Damage System
	* Damage application is a typical use of Gameplay Effects. Should this be where the GAS starts?
[ ] Health Component
