====== DevelopmentPlanning ======
Created Monday 29 April 2024

The mechanical systems I'd like to make are:
[ ] First-Person Movement and Shooting (should already be part of the FPS Template)
[ ] Networked Multiplayer
[ ] Basic Menus
[ ] Abilities
[ ] Selectable Abilities from a Menu
[ ] AI Teammates

After those are made, I'll move on to 'content'; making the game a real game instead of just a tech demo that exists in the template map. This'll include mechanical abilities, art and audio, and actual mech feel.
