This Project is going to be a Portfolio Piece for my Unreal/C++ abilities. Plan is to include the following...

Mechanics:
* First-Person Characters
* Selectable Gear
* Mech Abilities
* Multiplayer Matches
* AI Teammates

Using the following systems:
* FPS Characters
* Networking
* Gameplay Ability System
* AI
* UMG

That sounds like a lot, and it is, but the plan is to be reeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaalllllllyyyy content light. This is a portfolio piece, after all. The code is what matters here.
